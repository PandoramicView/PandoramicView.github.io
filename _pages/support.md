Links to some places that you can support me, if you like me and the things that I do and you're in a comfortable position to do so.

## Non-material Support:
Showing up and interacting with the things that I make is rad. If you know someone else who might appreciate it, share it. As cliched as it sounds, it's your way to have an impact... on my impact. 

## If you're looking to make a one-time donation:
I imagine you'll want to use [Paypal](https://paypal.me/pandoramic?country.x=US&locale.x=en_US), although I believe the option is also available through [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/pandoramic) and [Kofi](https://ko-fi.com/pandoramic). I get something like 95% of whatever you send.

## If you're looking to support me over time:
Then you'll probably want to hit up [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/pandoramic) and [Kofi](https://ko-fi.com/pandoramic). You can set the duration you like, or cancel, or whatever. I get something like 95% of whatever you send.

## If you'd like to receive cool things in return:
*(I think they're cool, anyway)* 

Head to my [Threadless Shop](https://pandoramic.threadless.com/) and see if anything strikes your fancy, or let me know if there's something I've already made that you'd want on some item they sell. It's no big deal to arrange it. I earn something like 25% from the sales, you get a *thing.* 

I chose Threadless because they appear to have a variety of good quality items that I'd like to design for, but if you find that the shit is whack, let me know and I'll figure something else out. I'm also giving Society6 the side-eye because they let you put your ideas onto household items, too, but that's not online yet.

**P.S.** If you have a suggestion for an alternative put-designs-on-items website, I'm open to it - please leave a comment below.

## If you want to get me something tangible:
Feel free to peruse my [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/LK6RI6DYAFKS?ref_=wl_share) or send me a message if you want to buy me [something I designed](https://pandoramic.threadless.com/) to make arrangements. 

## What happens when you do any of the above?
I experience a trade-secret mix of existential dread and big warm-fuzzies. 

To be honest, it feels a little weird to accept material support from others, but I'm an idealist and I think that the economic ecosystem of patronage is a cool way to make meaningful progress past the "meaningless job for wages" stage of capitalism. 

At the end of the day, all I want is the freedom to keep pursuing my projects, and support freely given is support humbly appreciated. I do my best to be frugal and manage myself well, and that's what I rely on to carry me forward.
