### AKA PandoramicView 
#### AKA Elizabeth

Life has been weird for me, but in the past few years I've had the opportunity to do and participate in some interesting stuff. I earned a BA in Animation, helped to run a small convention for three years, got to stare into the horrifying bowels of for-profit education during a weird and unexpected stint as president of the college's student body, had the pleasure of working on many small and mostly terrible games with many teams, stared into the also-horrifying bowels of one of the largest tech companies on the planet as a contractor (the future is near, friends, but the profit motive ruins everything), got married, got divorced (tl;dr: don't sacrifice your soul at the altar of love, yo - also: legal systems are whack), traveled internationally, traveled interstate, lived alone, lived with friends, ate bugs, moved states, started gardening, learned to cook, tried out diving and surfing and rock climbing, and left my home state in an awesomely dramatic scene (picture: huge wildfires are raging just on the other side of the hills four miles from your home, in which you are required to stay due to a mounting pandemic, the atmosphere is straight-up orange, you walk your big cardboard box to the UPS with a fine dust of ash floating down from the sky on the morning you head to the airport after your lease has ended, but you're eerily alone there for nearly half a day while you wait for your flight which is delayed time and again until finally you're forced to overnight, so you gorge on a take-out wet burrito while you wait to flee the apocalypse...).

At the moment, my adventure consists of tag-team caretaking for WSLaFleur's grandfather, who has introduced us to the wild world and mysteries of dementia, and in between all of that doing my best to figure out marshalling my time and skills to make good on my aspirations of becoming a healthy, studied person who makes rad-ass art and stories.
