## Why this?

I'd like to finish out the goals I set for myself in December. 100 feels like a nice number for the starting mileage on photo studies, and the rest is the meat of what I'd like to be working on anyway. I routinely build off of old sketches to make new paintings, but my painting skills haven't been up to snuff so I've been shy about it.

Enter this effort -- voila. There you go, a stronger sense of empowerment to tackle the things I'm really jonesing to make.
