## What is it?

It's an adjusted version of [Inktober](https://inktober.com/rules), where artists across the internet all follow along with the same set of prompts every day for the month of October. 

![2021's Inktober Prompt List](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5af1bd791aef1d143f85e67e/1630514938634-AV462LC7KADF4E34GAF7/2021promptlist.jpg?format=1000w)

## Why this?
It was a good balance to my goal of building an art habit for the month of October, since it was (compared to the anatomy challenge) relatively low-commitment, and made sure that I was getting some generative, creative art into my schedule and not just getting lost in technical study-land.
