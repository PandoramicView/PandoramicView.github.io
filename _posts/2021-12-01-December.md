## Why this?

After a month's challenge in my comfort zone (and then a month off to try NaNo, which got co-opted in the final two weeks to write an 80-something page BDR application, *whew*), it was time to get my friggin' feet wet with the whole painting business. Wes asked me how many color pieces I've ever done, and the number was definitely smaller than 100 (maybe smaller than 50), and mostly a few (or more) years back. 

The primary goal of this month's challenge was to get some real mileage under my belt and start identifying areas for more focused effort going forward, while also setting myself up to do some cool new personal work in the future. The plan following this was to start reading (again) James Gurney's [Color and Light](https://jamesgurney.com/products/color-and-light-a-guide-for-the-realist-painter-signed-by-james-gurney).
