## Comments

Actually a huge pain in the ass to set up, as a person who is only moderately technical. For someone who's comfortable and familiar with the languages and structures, I imagine it wouldn't be terrible, though. I'm using [Staticman](https://staticman.net/) because I'm a fan of not requiring anyone to sign up for some kind of account, and my [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) [theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) already plays well with it. That said, I still had to jump around to a few different places for documentation, including [this guide](https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2020/02/05/now-with-comments.html), [this other guide](https://mademistakes.com/mastering-jekyll/static-comments/), and this [additional guide for nested replies](https://mademistakes.com/mastering-jekyll/static-comments-improved/). Along the way, to my relief, I found out that you can use openssl through the GitHub desktop app instead of having to go through the intimidating process of setting up openssl otherwise.
