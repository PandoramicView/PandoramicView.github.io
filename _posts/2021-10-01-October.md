Started from the bottom up.

## Why this?

This was my first real leap back into art after a few years of mixed-priorities and business. I decided to start off with an area where I'm relatively comfortable, but technically weak: sketching people. The intent that I outlined for myself was as follows:
- Build a habit
- Tackle some weaknesses
- Shake off rust
- Small win - it's not a full-power thing to be proud of, but it's proof to myself that I have the ability to show up and it's progress toward the sort of work ethic I'd like to embody
- Build endurance and speed
