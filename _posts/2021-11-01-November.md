## What was it?

Check out the [NaNo Website](https://nanowrimo.org/about-nano).

### Goals:

Basically? Write 50k words throughout the month of November toward a new novel.


## Why this?

I've written something like a collective 200,000 words of fiction over the past decade and a half, but I wanted to get out of short stories and fanfiction and into long-form, original prose. I have a few stories I've been tossing around in my head, and it seemed as good a time as any to start making real headway in this arena.
