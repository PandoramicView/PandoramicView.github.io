I'm glad to say that I went 31/31 for prompt completion. This turned out to be a fairly reasonable add-on to the October Challenge I was doing, and was even complemented by it because I sketched primarily human figures for the prompts. 

## Take-aways?

Since this was mostly a creative exercise, there aren't many. It was a fun flex to try to come up with interesting spins on the prompts. I certainly had a challenge when it came to time management, but that was to be expected given the circumstances. In the end, I came away with some sketches I liked quite a lot, some I liked less, and a little bit of chagrin because it felt like a cop-out next to all the great work I was seeing in ink. Clean, well-weighed lines are not yet a part of my artistic wheelhouse, but that skillbuilding is for another time.
